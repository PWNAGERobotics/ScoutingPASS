# SCOUTINGPASS 4564 EDITION

## Heavily modified fork of FRC team 2451 "PWNAGE", made for FRC team 4564 "ORANGE CHAOS"

## This fork of SCOUTINGPASS maintains the skeleton of the original version, while implimenting many features our team is using. We use a offline server that has the data uploaded by USB, rather than by QR code. Once uploaded, the data is used with a prediction algorithm to make decisions during alliance selection.

## Features:

### Updated 2026 code, including questions and backend
### Heavy 4564 color design/aesthetics
### TSV File download
